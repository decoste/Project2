## Description
This app is an easy to use online banking app featuring a log in function and server side account storage. To use it simply click on 'sign up' and enter in your info! Once signed up you can see your account info and make deposits and withdrawals (with monopoly money of course!). For the login function we used Passport, and to generate unique IDs we used UUID. 

Here is the Github repository: https://github.com/decoste/project2/

And the deployed site can be seen on Heruko: https://jwaj.herokuapp.com/

The following GIF demonstrates the application functionality:
